This is my GNU Emacs.

* Why I use Emacs

Emacs is a highly extensible text editor. With the Emacs Lisp language, you can modify almost all of its functionality. This capability allows you to change existing code and see those changes reflected immediately. Additionally, due to the nature of Emacs Lisp, it is common for some users to believe in achieving functionality by utilizing external processes or collaborating with other systems instead of implementing everything solely in Emacs Lisp. By doing so, you can draw upon knowledge beyond Emacs, enhancing the possibilities based on the depth of that knowledge. What you cannot do on your own, you cannot achieve even with Emacs. In other words, Emacs grows alongside your own development. It serves as a partner that evolves with you, and that's why I choose to use Emacs.

* Setup

1. Install GNU Emacs.

   See the official installation document at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html, or you can [[Self build]].

2. Download a configuration files.

   #+begin_src
   git clone https://github.com/TakesxiSximada/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+end_src

3. Start GNU Emacs.

   Start GNU Emacs Application(=emacs -nw= , =open Emacs.app= etc).

* Self build

The official GNU Emacs distribution has several features disabled. To enable them, you need to build the application yourself. Here are the steps to do that, with the environment being targeted for macOS.

1. Install dependencies.

   #+caption: Install dependencies via Homebrew
   #+begin_src bash
   brew install \
        autoconf \
        texinfo \
        imagemagick \
        gnutls
   #+end_src

2. Download GNU Emacs source code.

   #+caption: Download GNU Emacs source code via Savannah.
   #+begin_src bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
   #+end_src

3. Move the working directory to the root directory of the source code.

   #+begin_src bash
   cd emacs
   #+end_src

4. Run the autogen script to generate the configure script.

   #+begin_src bash
   ./autogen.sh
   #+end_src

5. Execute the configure script to generate files needed for the build, such as the Makefile, specifying the features to enable as options.

   #+begin_src bash
   ./configure \
      --with-imagemagick \
      --with-mailutils \
      --with-modules \
      --with-ns \
      --with-pop \
      --with-xwidgets \
      --x-includes=/opt/X11/include \
      --x-libraries=/opt/X11/lib \
      --with-x
   #+end_src

4. Build the source code implemented in C.

   #+begin_src
   make
   #+end_src

5. Create an application bundle to be treated as an application on macOS, including the code implemented in Emacs Lisp.

   #+begin_src
   make install
   #+end_src

6. Move the application to the specified location under /Applications.

   #+begin_src
   sudo mv nextstep/Emacs.app /Applications
   #+end_src

* Emacs Literature

Emacs has dedicated fans who express their love for it through various forms, including technical essays. Within this community, there are individuals who have written about their experiences and feelings regarding Emacs, encompassing a wide range of perspectives that often include subjective and personal elements. These writings serve as a testament to their journeys in their work and aim to convey their unique thoughts. I refer to these pieces as Emacs Literature, and I enjoy reading them because they allow me to feel the humanity of the authors.

Here, I would like to introduce some renowned works of Emacs Literature. While some of these may be fictional, such distinctions are ultimately inconsequential. What truly matters is that each work overflows with love for Emacs.
